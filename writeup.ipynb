    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector.\n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "The codes for feature extraction of training step are contained in in lines 161 through 173 of the file called `main.py` and lines 86 through 99 of the file called `detect_util.py`.\n",
    "\n",

    "Here is HOG parameters and color space I used in this project:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    color_space = 'YCrCb' # Can be RGB, HSV, LUV, HLS, YUV, YCrCb\n",

    "\n",
    "I have tuned the orientation from 6 to 12, and the accuracy is better with bigger orientation number. But bigger orientation will cause more time to compute HOG.

    "### Sliding Window Search and Hog Subsampling\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes for this step (sliding window search) is implemented in lines 227 through 237 and lines 451 through 461 in `main.py`, and the default window size is 48X48 with 50% overlap. I have try sliding window with 3 size (48X48, 96X96, 144X144), and I found that window size `48X48` will take more time to compute HOG features and window size `144X144` may cover too large area (produce larger detected box than we need). Therefore, I use window size `96X96` with 75% overlap to search for smaller step than 50%. Smaller step can make detected boxes for the same car get closer, and let them form a larger box by `scipy.ndarray.measure.lable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a HOG subsampling search.  How did you decide what scales to search ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because sliding window search will need to compute HOG features in each window area, and those areas are overlapped by each other (depending on the overlap rate). Therefore, it will compute HOG features redundantly and cost extra time which is not good for realtime application. Hence, in lesson, we use another method called Hog subsampling, which compute HOG features for entire image and extra sub-area for prediction. The codes for HOG Subsampling is implemented in lines 10 through lines 76 in the file called `hog_subsample.py`, and the default window size is `64` as scale `1`.  I have manually try scale `1.0` through `2.0` with `0.1` each step, and I found that scale from 1.3 to 1.5 have better accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "For sliding window search, I only use one scale (window size `96X96`) with 75% overlap. For HOG subsampling, I also use one scale (`1.5` in subsampling will use window size `96X96`). And The feature vectors of my linear SVM classifier is YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images of both subsampling and Sliding window search:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above figure, I also show the computing time of both method, and it shows that HOG subsampling is about 4 times faster than Sliding window search. Therefore, I will use Subsampling method for video or realtime processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Video Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)\n",
    "Here's a [link to my video result](./project_output.mp4)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use `deque` (double side queue) to record the positions of positive detections in the recent N frames of the video (in lines 247 of `main.py`).  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions (from lines 304 through lines 317 of `mian.py`).  However, the threshold in heatmap will also reduce area of correct detection, I set threshold to 0 for my processing. I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap (from lines 322 to lines 330). In addition, after `label()`, I add another filter inside `draw_labeled_bboxes()`, and this filter compute the average heat point in each label area (from lines 105 to 108 of `hog_sumsample.py`). If one of label area has few average point (less than threshold), it means that this label only detect in one or two frame (total 6 or more frame). Then, I will skip the label with less average point.  Next, I assumed the rest of each blob (with high average heat point) corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image6]\n",
    "![alt text][image7]\n",
    "\n",
    "From above figure, I know that the detection of cars in opposite direction only show up in 3rd & 4th frames, so they will have less heat points after combine the result of 6 frames\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:\n",
    "![alt text][image8]\n",
    "\n",
    "From above figure, `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` can label all detected box in 6 frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:\n",
    "![alt text][image9]\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the label of cars in opposite direction has less average heat point, the filter skip two labels on the left. Therefore, it only draw bounding box on the right two label, which are cars we  want to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to remove false positive (car in opposite direction or shadows on the ground), I try to increase threshold of heatmap, but it will also reduce detect area of corrected detection. Therefore, I use another filter after labeling, and remove some labels with less average heat points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are still some false positives (such as shadows on the ground or trees on the sideroad) show up consist in several frame. It may not easy to remove by the filter. One of way to correct this is to add more tree images (and shadow images) to the non-car group of the training set and train the classifier to make a better prediction.\n",
